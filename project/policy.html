        <p>During a stage in my life, I needed to transition from my corporate attire during work hours and floral dresses during leisure time, to a more versatile and easy-to-wear style. Edna surprised me by first wanting to understand me as a person, not just my daily role. As we sorted through my closet, I was apprehensive about having to let go of my favorite pieces. However, Edna approached each item with reverence and asked about my personal connection and association with it. In the end, we ended up donating 70% of the items and did a little shopping. Edna goes beyond just putting together an outfit.

            <p>It’s easy to get lost among numerous brands, uncertain of what will be an investment rather than a disappointment. Following my signature approach you’ll get exactly what’s needed without stress of missing out.</p>

                                  <p>During a stage in my life, I needed to transition from my corporate attire during work hours and floral dresses during leisure time, to a more versatile and easy-to-wear style. Edna surprised me by first wanting to understand me as a person, not just my daily role. As we sorted through my closet, I was apprehensive about having to let go of my favorite pieces. However, Edna approached each item with reverence and asked about my personal connection and association with it. In the end, we ended up donating 70% of the items and did a little shopping. Edna goes beyond just putting together an outfit. She taught me to view each item as an ingredient that can be used in various combinations, making them incredibly satisfying and appealing, resulting in compliments from others</p>

                                  <p>During a stage in my life, I needed to transition from my corporate attire during work hours and floral dresses during leisure time, to a more versatile and easy-to-wear style. Edna surprised me by first wanting to understand me as a person, not just my daily role. As we sorted through my closet, I was apprehensive about having to let go of my favorite pieces. However, Edna approached each item with reverence and asked about my personal connection and association with it. In the end, we ended up donating 70% of the items and did a little shopping. Edna goes beyond just putting together an outfit. She taught me to view each item as an ingredient that can be used in various combinations, making them incredibly satisfying and appealing, resulting in compliments from others</p>
